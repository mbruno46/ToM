## Installation

Installers of the application for MacOS and Linux can be 
found [here](https://github.com/mbruno46/ToM/releases/latest).

### MacOS

  * ToM can be installed globally using the `dmg` file or locally by unpacking the `zip`
    distribution and moving the `ToM.app` to the preferred location, e.g. `$HOME/Applications`.

  * Any version of MacOS will prevent the usage of ToM, since its author is not an
    official Apple Developer. To be able to use ToM open 
    `System preferences -> Security and privacy` and click on `open anyway`
    as illustrated below.

  * If you run in *compilation errors* make sure to open ToM preferences and
    properly set the latex command, for example by specifying the full path
    of the `pdflatex` or `latexmk` executables in your system.
