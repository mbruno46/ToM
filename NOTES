NOTES:
  - "electron-updater": "4.3.9" is required to avoid error: fs/promises dependency not found
  - stopped tracking package-lock.json due to problem with Github finding security vulnerabitilies 
    in software not used by main program, but only by node environment.

TODO:
  - currently history forgotten when new file is loaded in editor; ideally 1 history for each file
  - add parenthesis automatic checking
